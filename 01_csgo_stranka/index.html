        <h1 id="A31">NEWS</h1>
        <p>A professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player was caught cheating — in a moment captured on Twitter
          video — which disqualified his team from a tournament in Shanghai and resulted in its dissolution later.

          Dotesports first reported the cheating and the aftermath; what’s most interesting is watching the player,
          Nikhil “forsaken” Kumawat of OpTic India, caught in the act. The incident happened at the Extremesland Zowie
          Asia CS:GO 2018 tournament, a major-tier event with a $100,000 prize pool. The tournament’s official Twitter
          channel supplied this clip on Friday showing an administrator examining Kumawat’s terminal and even
          restraining him, apparently as he was trying to delete the hack.</p>

        <h1 id="A10"> DUST 2</h1>
        <p>"Dust II", also known by its filename de_dust2, is a video game map featured in the first-person shooter
          series Counter-Strike. Dust II is the successor to "Dust", another Counter-Strike map, and was developed by
          David Johnston prior to the official release of the original Counter-Strike game. It was designed with the
          aims of simplicity and balance, based on its symmetrical design and two points, for which the two teams must
          fight over for control.

          The map was first released in March 2001 for the original Counter-Strike game and is present in all games in
          the series. Apart from graphical updates, it underwent minimal changes after its initial release, before
          receiving a major revision in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in October 2017. The map has been popular with
          players since its initial release, and both its original and revised design in Global Offensive have been
          positively received by players and mapmakers.</p>

          Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player currently playing for G2 Esports. He was named "eSports Player of<br>
          the Year" at The Game Awards 2015. He was considered the very best sniper in the game prior to a<br>
          change to the weapon's mobility, and by Duncan "Thorin" Shields, a self-proclaimed eSports historian and<br>
          controversial self-proclaimed Counter-Strike 'analyst', to have been the very best player in the game<br>
          prior to that change. Some of his previous teams include Titan, VeryGames, Team LDLC.com, Recursive<br>
          eSports, Clan-Mystik, and Team EnVyUs. He was a professional Counter-Strike: Source player before<br>

        <h1 id="Ab1">Overpass</h1>
        <p>
          The map's setting is a canal overpass and the park built above it in Berlin, Germany. The GSG-9 must protect<br>
          a stalled military shipment on a canal overpass while the Phoenix Connexion can either attack the shipment<br>
          head-on or attempt to destroy the overpass itself by bombing the pillar below.<br>
          <br>
          The Counter-Terrorists spawn in bombsite A, where the disabled cargo truck is located at. Meanwhile, the<br>
          Terrorists' Spawn Zone is around the bottom of the canal.<br>
          <br>
          Bombsite B is located below the CT Spawn Zone and can easily be accessed from a stairwell. In here, snipers<br>
          can easily guard here as a sniper nest is positioned towards the entire site.<br>

        <h1 id="A33">s1mple</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of his career he first started playing HellRaisers as a rifler. In the following years,<br>
          AWPera began to recover. Other teams were FlipSid3 Tactics or Team Liquid. In 2013, he moved to Lan Dodgers<br>
          and later to Courage Gaming, Hashtag, and Amazing Gaming.<br>
          <br>
          In September 2014, he signed the Hellraisers team contract with DreamHack Winter 2014. In January 2015,<br>
          due to a ban on playing on all ESL tournaments, the Hellraisers team left, this ban was canceled in February<br>
          2016 and joined the dAT Team, which was named FlipSid3 Tactics in less than a month. He worked there until<br>
          July 17, 2015, the reason for his departure was the omission in the ESWC 2015 semifinals and<br>
          disagreements in the team. During the ESWC 2015 tournament, the American player Martin Spencer (Hiko)<br>
          played for the FlipSid3 Tactics team. S1mple then acted in the Evolution teams, the worst players, and he<br>
          also returned to Hellraisers and FlipSid3 Tactics, where he worked as a substitute.</p>

          player and former Counter-Strike: Source player of Moroccan descent who most recently played for NoChance. He<br>
          began to play Counter-Strike just for fun and never thought he would reach such a high level. After paying<br>
          attention to some tournaments going on at the time, he began to strive to play in big teams. With a couple of<br>
          lucky invites, and after being accused of hacking several times, he found his way onto several teams like<br>
          VeryGames, Titan and Epsilon eSports.</p>

        <h1 id="Ad1">Cache</h1>
        <p>
          Cache (de_cache) is a custom Bomb Defusal map featured in Operation Bravo and in Operation Phoenix, available<br>
          in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.<br>
          <br>
          With the introduction of Operation Breakout, Cache became an official map. It is now part of Active Duty in<br>
          Competitive and Defusal Group Delta in Deathmatch and Casual. Unlike other maps in Active Duty, it is<br>
          entirely maintained by it's creator, FMPONE.<br>

      <div class="item">
        <h1 id="Aa1">Mirage</h1>
        <p>
          Mirage is a Bomb Defusal map for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The map was added to the game on June 6,<br>
          2013.<br>
          The map is themed like a Middle Eastern town, but because of its close resemblance to Moroccan style<br>
          architecture, it is likely set somewhere in Morocco.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h1 id="Ae1">Inferno</h1>
        <p>
          The map is set in a small town with European architecture. In the Global Offensive version, the presence of<br>
          the Separatist faction suggests that the map is definitely set in Italy, as evidenced by the signs written in<br>
          Italian seen around the map. However, the separatist faction is also present in the Basque country of Spain<br>
          and France, so it's plausible it could be there, too.<br>
          <br>
          The map is loosely rectangular, with the Counter-Terrorists spawning on one corner of the map and the<br>
          Terrorists on the diagonally opposite corner, and the two bombsites sitting at the other two corners.<br>
